## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance dark images using a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and various computer vision techniques. The primary goal is to improve the visibility and quality of images that suffer from low brightness and contrast, making them more usable and visually appealing.

## Prerequisites
To successfully run the project, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- Seaborn

## Usage
Open the main Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ directory:

Code:
jupyter notebook notebooks/Enhancing_dark_images_EDA.ipynb
- Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the EDA, apply image enhancement techniques, and evaluate the results.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Inspection:
Load the dataset of dark images and inspect their properties.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform EDA to understand the distribution of image properties like brightness and contrast.

3. Image Enhancement Techniques:
Apply various techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction, and filtering to enhance the images.

4. Evaluation:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the enhancement techniques using both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

5. Visualization and Results:
Visualize the enhanced images and compare them with the original ones.

## Results
The project successfully enhanced dark images, improving their brightness and contrast.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining EDA with computer vision techniques to enhance dark images. The methods applied not only improve visibility but also retain essential details in the images.

## Future Work
Explore deep learning-based approaches such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for more advanced image enhancement.
Implement noise reduction techniques to address the issue of noise amplification in extremely dark images.
